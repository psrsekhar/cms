# CMS Database Schema and Functionality

This document provides an overview of the database schema and functionality for a College Management System (CMS) designed for a university environment. The CMS manages information related to departments, employees, students, books, and book transactions. The database schema includes table structures, relationships, and stored procedures for managing book transactions.

# CMS Database Setup

This `README.md` provides instructions for setting up the CMS (Content Management System) database, including the creation of the database, tables, indexes, stored procedures, and sample data insertion.

## SQL Schema Overview

The `cms.sql` file creates a database schema for managing:

- Departments, Employees, and Students.
- Books and Book Transactions.
- User authentication and roles.

### Main Tables:

- `department`: Stores department information.
- `employee`: Stores employee data, including salary and experience.
- `users`: Manages users with credentials.
- `student`: Stores student data.
- `book`: Manages books in the library.
- `book_transactions`: Tracks the borrowing and returning of books.

### Additional Tables:

- `student_semisters`: Handles student semester data.
- `student_marks`: Stores marks for each student across different subjects.

### Stored Procedures:

- `insert_book_transaction_if_eligible`: Manages book borrowing eligibility for students.
- `update_book_transaction`: Updates the book return details and calculates fines for late returns or damaged/lost books.
